# Mobile Data Scraping with Selenium

**Description:**
This repository contains a dataset of mobile phone on 3,338 smartphone models, including brand, release year, operating system, display size, display resolution, camera specifications, RAM, battery capacity and current market prices in Bangladesh. The dataset is curated to facilitate machine learning projects aimed at predicting smartphone prices based on these features.

**Source:**
The data was scraped from [MobileDokan](https://www.mobiledokan.co/), a leading Bangladeshi website that provides comprehensive information on mobile phones,collected using Selenium.

**Dataset Features:**
- **Brand:** The manufacturer of the smartphone (e.g., Doogee).
- **Released Year:** The year the smartphone model was released (e.g., 2020).
- **OS:** The operating system running on the smartphone (e.g., Android 10).
- **Display (inches):** The size of the smartphone display in inches (e.g., 6.3").
- **Display (pixels):** The resolution of the smartphone display (e.g., 1080x2340).
- **Camera:** Details about the smartphone camera setup (e.g., 2.1MP).
- **Camera Resolution:** The resolution of the main camera in megapixels (e.g., 1080).
- **RAM:** The amount of RAM in gigabytes (e.g., 6GB).
- **Battery Capacity:** The capacity of the battery in milliampere-hours (mAh) (e.g., 10000mAh).
- **Price:** The current market price of the smartphone in Bangladesh (e.g., 18,000.00à§³).

**Usage:**
This dataset is ideal for a variety of data analysis and machine learning tasks, including but not limited to:
- Predicting smartphone prices based on specifications
- Analyzing trends in smartphone technology and pricing
- Comparing features and prices across different brands and models
- Identifying key features that influence smartphone pricing
